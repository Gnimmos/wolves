      "about11":"aims to organise this conversation. It is an arts-based research project, created by Nico Carpentier, that questions the power dynamics of the discursive-material relationships between human and non-human animals. The project is also an invitation to go on a Wolf Walk, and visit the twelve wolf-and-cat-face collage photographs, located at 12 different places in Prague, guided by this website. On each location, you can listen to a Wolf Talk, a sound fragment (connected with the photograph through a QR code), where a wolf will speak to you. Exceptionally, as a curtesy to you, they will speak your language. Or at least, you will understand them, even if they might challenge you a bit. ",
      "about2":"Of course, non-human animals can use language. They have vast repertoires of verbal and non-verbal communication at their disposal. They can talk, even if human animals can hardly understand them. But non-human animals cannot produce discourse, at least not when we see discourse as systematically articulated knowledge frameworks. This inability to produce discourses generates structural power imbalances, which places non-human animals in a fundamentally disadvantageous position. This imbalance is only worsened by the access that human animals have to advanced technologies. ",
      "about3":"Human animals have the ability to categorise and classify non-human animals through their discourses. They can label them as harmful, undesirable or simply irrelevant, thus, in some cases, legitimating species-cides. Predators, in particular, have been subjected to excessive violence, as they competed with human animals over territory and livestock. The European wolf, for instance, was almost completely eradicated from its habitat. One of the safe heavens that were created for them were the European zoos, but this produced a high cost for them, as these animals were then subjected to fierce restrictions, and became trapped in discursive-material enclosures.

But still, the question I want you to reflect about is whether my identity is fixed or contingent. When I was re-reading Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s work, I was again reminded how easily human animals essentialize our identity. You drove us almost to extinction, when you decided, not that long ago, that we were all the same: Vermin. Even now, we are all the same to you, exteriorisations of the category wolf, without recognition that we are all individuals. Of course, as in one of my favourite films, Monty Python’s “Life of Brian”, someone should now shout out: “I’m not!” to hyperbolically demonstrate his or her excess of individuality, but let’s not go there. Instead, let me mention the animot, the concept that Jacques Derrida developed to refer to the diversity that characterizes the animal world, and that will allow you to see more diversity than your categorisation of non-human animals allows you to do. Instead, let me point out to you that the meanings that you allocate to us are not stable, but have been changing over time and space. Apparently, now, we have become important enough to be protected, even if some of you still hunt us down. But our identity is not one, and it has never been one. Human animals have kindly developed different identities for us, sometimes even contradictory ones, struggling to capture our complex material behaviour. You have defined us as vermin, as competitor over resources, as threat, as totem, as similar to humans because of our social hierarchy, and many many more … Wouldn’t it be time for you to understand better that your discourses about us are diverse and contingent, because both your structures of meaning condensed in language and our behaviours are simply too complex to capture with one essentialist identity. Wouldn’t it be time to better understand that we’ll always escape your attempts to fixate and discipline us? I thank you for listening to me, my fellow creature on this planet.",
      "Am_I_a_wolf":"Yes. I finally made it to the wolf enclosure. Down there, in the enclosure, are my brothers and sisters. Or at least, my nephews and nieces. You just have look through the chain link fence to see them. I was so much looking forward to getting to meet them. Did you know that our DNA is very similar? We share a common ancestry. Of course, our paths separated, several thousand years ago. I’ve read some interesting theories about how this happened, and what made one or more wolves decide to go and live with humans. One interesting theory argues that some wolves were simply friendly and social, and decided to seek out human company. I like this self-domestication theory, because it gives us agency: Some of us chose to be in the company of humans, and adjusted to this co-habitation model. Of course, others decided not to adjust, not to seek out human company, and to stay wolves. But it was our decision. Or at least, our ancestors’ decision. I wonder why I am a bit nervous, though. I hardly dare to look down into the enclosure. Luckily, my human master is holding me tight. There is comfort in her firm grip. I feel so safe. Maybe I’ll just quickly peek down, when they are not paying any attention. They look awfully big, and strong. Should I talk to them? What will they respond, if I do? Will they approve of what we became? Will they judge me? Hold on, what am I thinking. I’m a Yorkshire Terrier. I’m a purebred. I should be proud of my lineage. I should look at the wolves with pride. But they do look awfully big, don’t they?",

      "Discurfication1":"I might not be a human animal, and I might not be able to produce discourses myself, at least not when we define discourse as frameworks of intelligibility, as knowledge structures. But I can explain you how discourses work, and how necessary they are for human’s understanding of the world. Just close your eyes, and think about a wolf. Maybe two. They exist in your mind now, right? They are real, because ideas are real. Now connect that idea with other ideas. For instance, connect—or articulate, as it is called—the idea of the wolf with the predator, with wildness, with growling and biting and violence, with killing, with a threat to your existence. Now you have (re)constructed the discourse of the wolf as a threat. It is the wolf of nightmares. The point I want to make is that you need this discourse to give meaning to me and my fellow wolves. Without that discourse, I wouldn’t even be a wolf; I’d be an undefined heap of flesh. ",
      "Discurfication2":"I would like to add something here: There is not one way of giving meaning to us; there is not one discourse. Empty your mind again. Think of the two wolves again. And connect them with care for wolf cubs. Think of them as family members, dealing with the complexities of an extended family. Think of them—well, us—as nurturing the sick and injured, and establishing friendships within the pack. What you now have configured is the discourse of the wolf as the social non-human animal. ",
      "Discurfication3":"I’m sorry for interrupting you, my friend, but I also need to explain that I, as a wolf, have little control over these wolf discourses. They are constructed by humans. You give meaning to us. You discursify us. You exercise discursive power over us. There is little we can do about this. But this is where things get complicated. My materiality, my body, my behavioural patterns, my communication does invite for particular discourses to be articulated. It would be hard to think of me as an insignificant object, because I have eyes that remind you of yours, because I have a mouth that produces sounds, similar to what you do, because I have legs and I can move, like you do, and even better, because I have teeth, which I use to eat meat, similar to what most of you do. My materiality invites for particular discourses to be connected to me, even though you, as human, can ignore these invitations, and exterminate me like vermin. Still, the invitation to configure us differently stands …",
      "Am_I_only_material":"Do you like my fur? Would you like to have it, as a coat? Or my teeth and claws, which you may want to use for a necklace? If you take my ears and tail, you can maybe play werewolf with them? I might not depart from them easily, but humans have their ways of getting what they want. We have been reduced to our material bodies, and in particular to our teeth, for centuries. Our bodies were seen as a threat, because we could, and did, kill. Our teeth took all your attention, and blinded you for what we also were. And now, in these zoos, we’re again reduced to bodies. Visitors come to see our bodies, preferably moving through the enclosure. It’s our bodies that are exhibited, and gazed at. Visitors don’t stay long enough to observe our social behaviours, and how we live together in a complex hierarchy that requires constant negotiation. Our language is insignificant to you, unless we let out a long howl, which seems to thrill you, because it confirms your stereotypes. And for the record, yes, we do have a language. We use a sophisticated combination of verbal and non-verbal signifying practices, that you may not understand. But that doesn’t mean that we do not have a language. Allow me to quote Derrida on this matter. Yes, I have read his work. Have you? In his “Eating well” interview, he said: “if one defines language in such a way that it is reserved for what we call man, what is there to say? But if one reinscribes language in a network of possibilities that do not merely encompass it but mark it irreducibly from the inside, everything changes.” End quote. What is more: Our skills and our knowledge, for instance, about hunting has not only become useless in this enclosure, but it has also become completely invisible. This is one of the many ways we became de-animalized, while we were the ones that offered your ancestors the knowledge on how to hunt, by example. Maybe a bit more respect for our wolf culture would be good?",
      "DoIHaveAgency":"Now that I have put on my glasses, I want to talk to you about agency. You humans often reserve this concept for human activities, and for the freedom you think you have. In your dictionaries, agency refers to the ability to make free choices, and to act independently. Isn’t this the best example of anthropocentrism? How self-centred can you humans get, if even the very notion to capture freedom is reserved to humans. Of course, this is where the contradictions arise, and I will be happy to discuss some of these contradictions with you. We—wolves—are simultaneously seen as the embodiment of freedom, by humans. You envy our capacity to roam through the woods, not held back by too many things. We do as we please. We go where we please. We don’t need to worry about mortgages or the rent, salaries or finding a new job, what new clothes or new car to buy, what medical treatment to get, when to have children, … I don’t want to romanticize our wolfish experience, but we are as free as one can get. We are freer than you are, and still, you reserve the notion of agency for humans? I have this little theory that this exactly is why you trap us into zoos. You take away our freedom, because then you appear to be freer yourself, while … you are the ones locked into concrete (or brick) houses, jobs, and families. You unconsciously desire to have our freedom, but it’s out of your reach. And that’s why you take away ours. I am here to tell you that you can’t. I’m here to tell you that I still have agency, even if you lock me into this zoo enclosure. Now that new materialist philosophers acknowledge that even the most solid materials have agency, it is time to make this point loud and clear: I have agency. I am a free wolf.",
      "Can_I_Resist":"Am I not majestic on this picture, with my pink outfit? Actually, that’s what you turned me into: A travesty. I put on these pink cat-ears to make a point, not to please your perverted sense of aesthetics. Actually, I never understood why humans put on digital cat ears. Who wants to be a cat, if you can be a wolf? But I am digressing again – a bad habit of mine. Let me introduce you to my current home, which is this pretty small enclosure in the zoo, where I am exposed to your human gaze. By the way, did you know that a brother of mine in Mongolia covered more than 7000 kilometres in one year? Maybe this snippet of information gives you an idea how small this enclosure is to me. Still, I may be locked in, but my mind wonders freely. One of the texts I cannot get out of my mind is Laura Mulvey’s article on the male gaze: “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema”. It is quite an old text about Hollywood cinema, published in the mid-1970s, if I remember well. Mulvey’s argument is that film produces fixed positions, with spectators who look from the perspective of a male protagonist, at a female eroticised star. Obviously, I’m quite sexy, but that is not the point. Digressing again. I’m a non-human animal, exposed to the human gaze, which reduces me to a sample of a species. And this enclosure traps me, and prevents me from escaping that human gaze. Sure, I could escape, but where would I go to? I would be hunted down, sedated in the best possible scenario and killed in the worst. And the city is not really my habitat. Still, I can resist. One most pleasant way is to relax, out of sight, somewhere behind a tree. From a corner of my eyes, I can then see the visitors, who are wondering where the wolves are, while all they see is trees and bushes. I can see how they talk to their disappointed children, who so much wanted to see a wolf but end up staring into the void. I can almost hear their parents say that the nearby elephants are so much better. I wholeheartedly agree: The elephants are much better to stare at, so you should go there. But I also have a second way to resist my entrapment: I can put on my pink ears, produce my saddest look, and expose you to my animal gaze. Maybe this will make you reconsider, next time you stare at me.",
      "Can_I_Dislocate":"I have another question for you. Can I dislocate discourse? Of course I can. I can’t produce discourse, though, that’s a human activity. I can bark, whimper, growl and howl. In other words, I can use language, even if you can’t understand me. Actually, I can communicate in rather sophisticated ways, I would add. But I can’t produce these frameworks of intelligibility that you call discourse. This is one of the reasons why you, my dear human, can dominate me. You can construct classification systems that structure me. You can label me a “European wolf”, and ignore my individuality. You can construct my identity as wolf, and tell stories about how cruel I am, threatening your children, livestock and territory. You can use my teeth as metaphor, to reduce me to my bite. You can regret having almost exterminated me, and now preserve me in an enclosure, for you to stare at me, in a prison built to protect me from your slaughter that killed so many of my brothers and sisters. You have everything figured out nicely. But I am sure that you, some time ago, on a candlelit evening, read Michel Foucault’s work on power and resistance. Do you remember this one sentence: “Where there is power, there is resistance, and yet, or rather consequently, this resistance is never in a position of exteriority in relation to power”? You might remember it. But I … I practice it. My body disrupts your discourses that neatly categorise us. Just look into my eyes. Do you still see a category? Or do you see an individual wolf? Do you see my personality? And look at our wolf pack, perfectly organised and balanced. Do you still think we’re uncivilised? And do look at my teeth, as they can still sink into my prey, even if a human caretaker carefully provides it to me? Am I not a reminder how easy it is for you to turn to violence, if you need to? Do you recognize your genocidal self in my eyes? Look at me, look into my eyes, and tell me: Who is the real animal now?",
      "Am_I_fixated":"Discourse is a tool of power. How you define reality, and how you know reality, is not neutral. It is actually one of the main locations of power. You humans can produce meaning in a variety of ways. The options are almost endless. Power lies in the fixation of the options of signification. Let me use myself, a wolf, as an example. You could think of me as your equal, as a non-human animal that merits the same degree of respect as human animals. You can think of me as a creature that has equal rights to the spaces and places of the planet. As a creature that has a right to live. Or maybe you could think of me as a god, or a spiritual guide. Or, you could think of me as a nuisance, as a potential danger. These are all options of signification. But some of these ideas about me have become dominant, and they structure how you think about me, how you interact with me. Don’t think that these discourses are your individual choice only, though. They have been circulating for centuries, produced over generations of humans. They fixate me in discourse, yes. They produce meanings about me that are hard to change. But they also fixate you, my dear human. They define who you are just as much. The good news, for all of us, is that these discursive fixations can change. They are strong forces, but they are not omnipotent. They are contingent, they can change over time and space. You, as an individual, might not be able to change them on your own, but at the social level, they can be changed, even if these old ways of thinking are grounded in century-old anxieties. And, what we—wolves—can also do, is to dislocate them. We act in complex and always slightly different ways, which can disrupt your ways of thinking. If I look at you, with my kind and always slightly sad eyes, for long time, you might eventually come to see that I am an animal, not unlike you, and maybe that will be instrumental in developing a different way of thinking about me.",
      "Do_I_Control":"Look at my muscles for a second. Look at me run, elegantly and even ferociously. I control this space. It is mine. I have carved out pathways, that are familiar to me. I know every turn; I could close my eyes, and follow them blindly, using only my sense of smell. I enjoy them, my body desires for them, as I need to run. My movement is me, and I am my movement. But when three o’clock comes, my habit changes. I relax, and stare at the gate, through which a human animal will soon carefully enter, pushing a wheelbarrow with food. I’ll keep some distance, because the caretaker always looks a bit troubled. They know they are entering my territory. Maybe that knowledge is enough, and I shouldn’t make the point too clearly. After all, life at the zoo hotel is not too difficult. I do wonder about these other humans, though, because they hardly move. They stroll towards this glass wall, and they stand there, for a while, staring at us. As if they have never seen a wolf. Curious creatures. A bit impolite, though, without wheelbarrow and food. When I came here, I did have to get used to these glass walls. You hardly see them, and I banged into them, on a couple of occasions. One learns, though. I do dream about them, once in a while, imagining that they are gateways into different worlds, with their own pathways, and forests and wheelbarrows. I dream about pathways that allow me to go clockwise, and not the infinite counter-clockwise I am using now. Maybe there are even other ways of moving, avoiding the circle that I’ve grown so much used to. Wouldn’t it be nice to go straight, and not to have to turn? Wouldn’t it be nice to walk towards the horizon, and see which wheelbarrows are beyond it?",
      "I_zoo_assemblage":"Tell me: What am I in the zoo assemblage? Am I at the centre stage, the animal around which everything revolves? Am I the reason why the zoo exists? I like to think so. But I know better. The zoo assemblage combines many different components, and has many different reasons of existence. The zoo assemblage groups many different discourses, that all give meaning to our presence. There is the discourse of conservation, where we become representatives of a species, and are subjected to intense human control, to keep the bodies of ourselves and our future generations alive, even if we, as animals, have already ceased to exist, as we were removed from the assemblage we originally belonged to. There is the discourse of research, where we are part of a huge and ever-lasting experiment to study our everyday behaviour, disregarding the artificial environment in which we are placed. This discourse legitimates our exposure to permanent surveillance, but also to the violence of classification and categorisation, which remove our individuality. There is the discourse of education, where we are expected to serve as reminders that there is something like nature outside, and that humans should respect us. I still need to be convinced that there is a relationship between a zoo and human respect for non-human animals, while we find ourselves trapped in an enclosure, which is arguably a bit disrespectful. And of course, last but not least, there is a capitalist discourse. We’re all part of a market economy, where visitors need to generate income, through entrance fees and animal sponsorships. And these are just the discursive components. There are also so many material components. I wouldn’t know where to start. There are all the buildings of the zoo, in this lovely park. There are the bodies of administrators and caretakers, of shopkeepers and visitors. There are the fake and real rocks, the cages in which we are placed, the glass panels that allow visitors a good view. And there is me. So now you see, I’m only one little part of the zoo assemblage. But the thing is: This isn’t my assemblage. It is not mine. ",
      "Can_you_really":"Ain’t I cute? I think I represent a wolf, even if I’m not entirely sure. How real am I, sitting on the shelves of the zoo shop? I might be a representation of a wolf, but I wouldn’t describe myself as a very successful one. I’m more of an interpretation than a representation. It’s a bit of an identity crisis for me, actually. I know that there are limits to mimetic representations, but a bit of a closer resemblance to a wolf, and a little less cuteness, would have been nice. I would have felt more like a wolf, instead of … well … instead of a toy. It also doesn’t help that I am part of the commodification logic of the zoo. I have a price tag, just below me, and for the right price, you can take me home. But what are you buying? A wolf? A stuffed toy? A rather unsuccessful fluffy representation of a wolf? Something soothing to place in a child’s bedroom? What is actually my purpose? To remind you of what you cannot buy? Of what you cannot own? You can’t buy a real wolf, that’s for sure. Of course, you pay an amount, which is a bit excessive, in order to contribute to keeping the zoo open, and to get to see the wolves for real. But when you buy me, am I not just a surrogate for what you can never own, or control? Maybe I am what Jean Baudrillard called a simulacrum? You know, an object that has no connection to reality anymore. Maybe I am not real at all. And maybe, when you buy me, you are just donating money to the zoo. That’s fine for me. Can you please pay now, and take me to the children’s bedroom? Thinking about these things makes me awfully tired. And I feel very alone, being so unreal. Could I please have a hug, just to make me feel real again?",
      "is_this_life":"Here is what is left of me. Some skin. Fur. Teeth. Claws. I’m mounted, with my insides stuffed. My history is a bit blurry, I must confess. I came from the Dvůr Králové Zoo, that I know. But with the best possible intentions, I don’t know where I was before. Maybe I came from Slovakia. My history has been erased. I only have a present, as a mounted body. There are a few other things I know, though. In the 19th and early 20th century, things were pretty bad for us, wolves. For instance, in the Czech lands, the last wolf in the Šumava forest was killed in 1874, while the last wolf in the Moravian–Silesian Beskids mountain range, on the other side of the country, was killed in 1914. There is still a memorial for that poor fellow in the mountains. It took a hundred years for us to re-appear in the Czech Republic, and there are still only a few of us there, living on the edges of the country. I am happy for them. But my body raises different questions. Why am I on display? Why was I transformed into an object? And why are you looking at me? What makes my body relevant to you? You could watch some nature documentaries, which would feature some of my living brothers and sisters. Wouldn’t that be more relevant to you? More educational? Maybe I am just a reminder of past times, when hunters would mount wolves as trophies, as evidence of their courageous act of killing from a safe distance? I could accept that role, as it symbolizes the history of human cruelty towards us. But wouldn’t that role work better, if I wouldn’t have been completely decontextualized? If I would have a history? If I would be more than an object? If I had a name, even if was given to me by the humans working in the zoo where I was before? I could accept that little bit of anthropomorphic behaviour, because it would at least indicate my individuality. Now, I’m only an object.",
