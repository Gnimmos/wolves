Here, I won’t look at you. I prefer to ponder, and stare into the distance. Or maybe I’m just pretending, who knows? But still, the question I want you to reflect about is whether my identity is fixed or contingent. When I was re-reading Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s work, I was again reminded how easily human animals essentialize our identity. You drove us almost to extinction, when you decided, not that long ago, that we were all the same: Vermin. Even now, we are all the same to you, exteriorisations of the category wolf, without recognition that we are all individuals. Of course, as in one of my favourite films, Monty Python’s “Life of Brian”, someone should now shout out: “I’m not!” to hyperbolically demonstrate his or her excess of individuality, but let’s not go there. Instead, let me mention the animot, the concept that Jacques Derrida developed to refer to the diversity that characterizes the animal world, and that will allow you to see more diversity than your categorisation of non-human animals allows you to do. Instead, let me point out to you that the meanings that you allocate to us are not stable, but have been changing over time and space. Apparently, now, we have become important enough to be protected, even if some of you still hunt us down. But our identity is not one, and it has never been one. Human animals have kindly developed different identities for us, sometimes even contradictory ones, struggling to capture our complex material behaviour. You have defined us as vermin, as competitor over resources, as threat, as totem, as similar to humans because of our social hierarchy, and many many more … Wouldn’t it be time for you to understand better that your discourses about us are diverse and contingent, because both your structures of meaning condensed in language and our behaviours are simply too complex to capture with one essentialist identity. Wouldn’t it be time to better understand that we’ll always escape your attempts to fixate and discipline us? I thank you for listening to me, my fellow creature on this planet.
